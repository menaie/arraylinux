## Build
### build it on your home folder (recommended)

    $ git clone https://github.com/menaie/arraylinux

Create the folder named "array-repo" in root folder ``/array-repo/``

Move all packages inside "repo" folder on the cloned repository to /array-repo/ and create a local repository using:

     # to create the repo
    $ repo-add /array-repo/array-repo.db.tar.gz
     
     # to add packages to the repo
    $ repo-add -n /array-repo/array-repo.db.tar.gz *.zst

If you want to add any other packages, you should add the package (which has .pkg.tar.zst extension) inside ``/array-repo/`` and do the command to add the packages to the local repo again

 then modify ``packages.x86_64`` inside ``arraylinux/arraylinux-hyprland/`` by putting the name of the package added in any line

Now you can proceed to modify anything you want before building the ISO by doing these commands:

    $ mkdir ~/work
    $ mkdir ~/out

    $ sudo mkarchiso -v ~/arraylinux/arraylinux-hyprland -w ~/work -o ~/out

or you can write a script called ``build.sh`` or anything you want

    #!/bin/bash

    mkdir ~/work
    mkdir ~/out

    sudo mkarchiso -v ~/arraylinux/arraylinux-hyprland -w ~/work -o ~/out
then do ``chmod +x build.sh``

If you need to change anything, you should use ```sudo rm -r``` on both folders "work" and "out" before building the ISO again
